  "course_description": "Propositions are everywhere in the philosophy of mind. Believing, hoping, and intending (for example) are said to be \"propositional attitudes\", mental states that involve relations to propositions. The seminar will examine issues at the heart of the dispute between the proposition-aficionados and their detractors. The course will be divided into five parts, covering: (1) de se thought; (2) propositions; (3) knowing how; (4) perceptual content; (5) the knowledge argument.\n",
