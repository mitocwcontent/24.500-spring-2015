Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _24.500 Topics in Philosophy of Mind: Mental Content_ as it was taught by Alex Byrne and Agustín Rayo in Spring 2015.

Propositions are everywhere in the philosophy of mind. Believing, hoping, and intending (for example) are said to be “propositional attitudes,” mental states that involve relations to propositions. This seminar examines issues at the heart of the dispute between the proposition-aficionados and their detractors. The course is divided into five parts: (1) de se thought; (2) propositions; (3) knowing how; (4) perceptual content; and (5) the knowledge argument.

_Below, Alex Byrne and Agustín Rayo describe various aspects of how they taught _24.500 Topics in Philosophy of Mind: Mental Content_._

### Selecting Content

In this class, the specific readings often followed naturally from the topics we addressed. There are certain classic pieces any discussion of (say) knowing how should include, and we read those. We also took advantage of visitors to MIT and philosophers in the area whose research included topics from the seminar, and invited them to give presentations.

### Keeping Class Engaging

Some of the topics we discussed in the class led naturally to rich discussion, because they raised methodological questions about how best to attack the problems around which the debates were centered.

Moreover, we, as the instructors, disagreed on many philosophical issues and aired our disagreements in the seminar. This made for a more lively class, and was also (we think) helpful for the students.

We devoted the final session of the class to student-presentations, with each student spending 15 or 20 minutes talking about their final paper. This seemed like a fun and interesting event for all concerned. We thought it was especially helpful for students to get feedback from their peers, and to get a sense of what others were working on.
