Final Paper (20–25 Pages)
-------------------------

Due last session

Students are required to present their final paper topics one day prior to the last class session. Presentations should be approximately 20 minutes long. The final paper should consist of an in-depth discussion of a philosophical issue related to course topics and the assigned readings.

Some sample paper topics are:

**Methodology**

What can a linguistic analysis of attitude ascriptions teach us about the mind?

**Conceptual and Non-Conceptual Content**

How does McDowell argue for the view that perceptual content is conceptual in Mind and World? Are his arguments successful?

**Guises**

Philosophers sometimes say that a proposition is believed relative to a “guise” or “mode of presentation”. How might such a proposal be spelled out in detail?
